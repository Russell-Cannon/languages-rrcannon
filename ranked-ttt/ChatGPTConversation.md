> How can I build a full stack webserver (Postgres -> JSON -> HTML, CSS, and JS) in docker for a ranked tic tac toe game?

I dropped a complete, dockerized template in the canvas—clone those files, copy `.env.example` → `.env`, then run `docker compose up --build` and open `http://localhost:8080` to get a Postgres-backed Node/Express JSON API that serves a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS tic-tac-toe UI with ELO-based rankings and a simple leaderboard.

> What happened in web/app.js? It appears as though it is cut off

I’ve restored the full `web/app.js` section so it’s complete from start to finish; nothing is cut off anymore.

> Its giving me this error: time="2025-09-05T11:52:53-06:00" level=warning msg="C:\\Users\\rxcan\\Documents\\S3\\languages\\languages-rrcannon\\ranked-ttt\\docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion"

The warning about `version` in `docker-compose.yml` is harmless (just delete the line), but the real error means Docker Desktop isn’t running or Compose can’t reach the engine on Windows.  

To fix:  
1. Make sure **Docker Desktop** is installed and started.  
2. Run `docker ps` in PowerShell or CMD; if it fails, Docker isn’t running.  
3. If it works, rebuild explicitly with `docker compose up --build` from your project root.  
4. If you still get `ranked-ttt-app` not found, check your service name: Docker will build it as `ranked-ttt-app:latest`, so confirm you’re not trying `docker run` directly; only use `docker compose up`.  

Would you like me to adjust the `docker-compose.yml` so it’s fully Compose v2-style (no `version`, explicit `container_name`, etc.) for Docker Desktop on Windows?

That error is because there’s no `package-lock.json` in your `server/` folder, but the `Dockerfile` is using `npm ci` (which requires one).  

Two easy fixes:  

### Option 1: Generate a lockfile  
From your **host machine**, go into `server/` and run:  
```sh
npm install
```
This will create a `package-lock.json`. Then rebuild:  
```sh
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Option 2: Change the Dockerfile to not require a lockfile  
Edit `server/Dockerfile` and replace:  
```dockerfile
RUN npm ci --only=production
```  
with:  
```dockerfile
RUN npm install --omit=dev
```  

Then rebuild with `docker compose up --build`.  

👉 If you want reproducibility and faster installs, I recommend Option 1 (commit `package-lock.json`).  

Do you want me to rewrite the Dockerfile in your project to use `npm install --omit=dev` so you don’t need to manage a lockfile manually?

> I couldn't get the second option to work and it doesnt recognize 'npm' when I try the first option

Got it — that’s because `npm` isn’t installed globally on your Windows machine, so running `npm install` in `server/` fails before Docker ever sees it.  

Here’s the simplest way forward (no need to install Node locally):  

1. **Change the Dockerfile** so it doesn’t depend on `npm ci` or a lockfile.  
   Edit `server/Dockerfile` and replace this block:  
   ```dockerfile
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci --only=production
   ```  
   with:  
   ```dockerfile
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install --omit=dev
   ```  

2. Make sure your `server/package.json` is actually copied into the container. You already have it, so that’s good.  

3. Rebuild cleanly:  
   ```sh
   docker compose build --no-cache
   docker compose up
   ```  

That way the Node image inside Docker will run `npm install` for you, and you don’t need Node/npm on your host.  

⚡ If it still errors after this, could you paste the updated `Dockerfile` content back to me so I can double-check?

> It ran! But localhost:8080 says error and the page just says 'Cannot GET /'

Great progress — the container runs, so now it’s just a routing issue.  

Right now your Express server serves only `/api/*` and tries to serve static files from `/app/public`, but in the Dockerfile we only made the folder and in `docker-compose.yml` we bind-mounted `./web → /app/public`.  

Two common causes for `Cannot GET /`:  
1. **Static folder mismatch**: in `server/src/index.js` you have  
   ```js
   const publicDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'public');
   app.use(express.static(publicDir));
   ```  
   But your `docker-compose.yml` mounts the frontend at `/app/public`, not `../../public`.  
   → Fix: change that to:  
   ```js
   const publicDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public');
   app.use(express.static(publicDir));
   ```  
   or even simpler, just:  
   ```js
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```  

2. **Frontend not mounted**: make sure `docker-compose.yml` has:  
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./web:/app/public
   ```  
   and that `./web/index.html` exists on your host.  

👉 Quick test: open `http://localhost:8080/index.html` — does your HTML appear? If yes, then the problem is just the missing static root for `/`.  

Would you like me to rewrite `server/src/index.js` so `/` automatically serves `index.html` from `/app/public`?

> Alright, I did what you said. How do I run this?
> Do I always:
> 1. docker compose build --no-cache
> 2. docker compose up 
> ?

You only need the full `docker compose build --no-cache` when you’ve **changed the Dockerfile or package.json** (anything that affects how the image is built).  

Most of the time, if you just change JS/HTML/CSS inside `web/` or `server/src/`, you can simply run:  
```sh
docker compose up --build
```  
(the `--build` makes sure it rebuilds if needed).  

If the containers are already running, you can just stop them with `Ctrl+C` and restart with:  
```sh
docker compose up
```  

⚡ So:  
- **Code changes only** → `docker compose up` (fast).  
- **Dependency/Dockerfile changes** → `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up`.  

Want me to add hot-reloading (nodemon + volume mounts) so you don’t have to rebuild/restart every time you edit server code?

> That's alright. Its running now but the page just has a postgres logo and 'Server is up and running'

That means your Express server is working, but it’s only returning the default message instead of your game UI. Right now, your backend is serving static files, but your `web/` folder probably only has the placeholder index.html with the Postgres logo.  

To actually see the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need to replace `web/index.html`, `web/style.css`, and `web/app.js` with the frontend files I scaffolded earlier — those contain the board, click handlers, and leaderboard logic.  

👉 Check inside your project’s `web/` directory: do you see a minimal placeholder HTML file, or the full Tic-Tac-Toe UI?

> I see the whole thing in web/ could it be something else?

If the full UI exists in `web/`, but you’re still seeing just the Postgres logo + "Server is up and running," that means Express isn’t actually serving `web/index.html` — it’s just returning your fallback route.  

Two things to check:  

1. **Static middleware path**  
   In `server/src/index.js`, make sure you have:  
   ```js
   import path from "path";
   import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

   const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
   const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

   const publicDir = path.join(__dirname, "..", "..", "public");
   app.use(express.static(publicDir));
   ```  
   That ensures `/app/public/index.html` is served.  

2. **Remove the catch-all default**  
   If you still have this at the bottom:  
   ```js
   app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Server is up and running"));
   ```  
   it **overrides** your static index page. Delete that line (or move it above the static middleware but for `/api/health` instead).  

👉 After that, restart with `docker compose up --build` and go to `http://localhost:8080/` — it should load `web/index.html` instead of the text.  

Want me to rewrite `server/src/index.js` cleanly so it serves the frontend from `/` and reserves `/api/*` for the backend only?

> I can't find the line in the second step. Is that supposed to be in index.js?

Yes — that line would be in `server/src/index.js`, if you copied a snippet like:  

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Server is up and running"));
```  

If it’s not there, then Express is probably falling back because the `publicDir` path is wrong and it can’t find your `index.html`.  

Right now you have something like:  
```js
const publicDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'public');
app.use(express.static(publicDir));
```  

But since your frontend lives in `/app/public` (via docker-compose mount), the safer way is:  
```js
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// serve static files from mounted /app/public
const publicDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "public");
app.use(express.static(publicDir));

// explicitly serve index.html at root
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(publicDir, "index.html"));
});
```  

👉 This guarantees `http://localhost:8080/` loads your `web/index.html`.  

Want me to update your `index.js` snippet in the project so it has exactly this setup?

> Sure

I’ve updated `index.js` so it now explicitly serves your `web/index.html` at `/` and correctly uses the `public` directory — visiting `http://localhost:8080/` should now load your game UI instead of the placeholder text.

Those errors mean your frontend is trying to call `/api/players`, but Express isn’t actually serving that route — so instead of JSON, it’s getting your fallback HTML page (hence the `<DOCTYPE` error).  

Here’s why this happens:  

- We added `app.get("/api/players", ...)` in `index.js`, but your **database probably doesn’t have a `players` table yet**, so the query fails or the route never runs.  
- Or, if you copy-pasted slightly differently, maybe that route didn’t make it into your running code at all.  

✅ To fix:  
1. Check `server/src/index.js` really has:  
   ```js
   app.get("/api/players", async (req, res) => {
     const { rows } = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY rating DESC");
     res.json(rows);
   });
   ```  
2. Make sure the database has a table to query. From inside the `db` container:  
   ```sh
   docker exec -it <db_container_name> psql -U postgres -d ttt
   ```  
   Then run:  
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     rating INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1000
   );
   INSERT INTO players (name, rating) VALUES ('Alice', 1200), ('Bob', 1100);
   ```  

Now if you refresh `http://localhost:8080`, the `/api/players` request should return JSON instead of HTML.  

👉 Do you want me to add an automatic migration step in your server startup (so the `players` table is created if it doesn’t exist)?

> Thats fine. I added it myself. I am still having trouble though. I thought I was missing JQuery but linking to it solved nothing. 

Your Join/Sign In fails because the frontend calls `POST /api/players` but your server only has `GET /api/players`, so Express returns the HTML fallback (hence `Unexpected token '<'`).  

Add these **before** the static fallback and after `app.use(express.json())`:
```js
// create or fetch a player
app.post("/api/players", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { name } = req.body;
    if (!name || name.length > 32) return res.status(400).json({ error: "Name 1-32 chars required" });
    await pool.query(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players(
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
        name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        rating INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1000
      ); CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;`);
    const upsert = `
      INSERT INTO players(name) VALUES($1)
      ON CONFLICT (name) DO UPDATE SET name = EXCLUDED.name
      RETURNING id, name, rating`;
    const { rows:[player] } = await pool.query(upsert, [name]);
    res.json(player);
  } catch (e) { next(e); }
});

// keep your existing GET /api/players ...
app.get("/api/players", async (req, res) => {
  const { rows } = await pool.query("SELECT id, name, rating FROM players ORDER BY rating DESC");
  res.json(rows);
});

// helpful: make 404s under /api return JSON, not HTML
app.use("/api", (req, res) => res.status(404).json({ error: "Not found" }));
```
Then restart with `docker compose up --build`; the favicon 404 is harmless (add a blank `/public/favicon.ico` if you want to silence it).

> Its working! But how would I play against someone? I have to tabs open signed in with different accounts but they both say: 'No opponent; play locally and submit.' Is this supposed be how it works?

Yes—this scaffold is local-only; to actually play someone, add a `/api/match?playerId=…` endpoint that returns the closest-rating other player (and a `/api/games` POST to record results), then upgrade to WebSockets (rooms + turn events) so both tabs share one game state in real time.

> Can you add that for me?

I added matchmaking (`GET /api/match`) and game recording with ELO updates (`POST /api/games`) to the canvas—paste those into `server/src/index.js`, rebuild with `docker compose up --build`, open two tabs, click Join on each, and they’ll auto-pair to the nearest-rating opponent.

> You know what, lets make it real time

Done—I've added a Socket.IO realtime upgrade in the canvas; update the listed files, run `docker compose up --build`, open two tabs, click “Find Match,” and you’ll be paired with live turn sync and auto ELO updates on game end.

> Why does it say failed to edit in this reply?

Good catch — that “failed to edit” message wasn’t about your code, it was me bumping into a pattern mismatch when trying to patch the canvas automatically. I then re-applied the changes by appending them instead, which worked (that’s why you see the realtime upgrade content added at the end of the canvas).  

In other words: your document **did update successfully**, and you’ve now got the Socket.IO realtime code scaffolded in there. The “failed” line is just a record of the first attempt that didn’t match the document structure.

> Can you create a readme for this project?

I drafted a full **README** for your project with setup steps, features, database schema, gameplay flow, and development notes — it’s now in the canvas, so you can expand or tweak it directly there.
